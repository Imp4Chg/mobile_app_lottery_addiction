    "# Mobile App for Lottery Addiction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lottery addiction is a growing issue across demographics. Most participants start playing the lottery for fun. However, it rapidly becomes an addiction for many due to its compulsive influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lottery players quickly graduate from using loose change, to spending their savings and loans and furthermore, start to accumulate debts which sometimes lead to theft in some cases or other self-sabotaging behaviours.\n",
    "\n",
    "A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling additions is looking to build a mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. A team of engineers has been set up by the institute that will build the app, but they need a logical core created for them with the probabilites calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first version of the app, the institute wants to focus on the [6/49](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) lottery and build functions that enable users answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning the big prize, if we play 40 different tickets or any number?\n",
    "* What is the probabily of having at least 5 numbers (or four or three or two or one) winning numbers on the ticket\n",
    "\n",
    "[The data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) we examine for this project is available on Kaggle. The data was drawn from Canada where Lotto 6/49 is one of the national lottery games."
